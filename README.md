# oratory-dl
Download oratory1990 EQ settings and convert to text format (for SoundSource/Eq. APO)

Note: This CLI downloads oratory1990's [EQ presets](https://www.reddit.com/r/oratory1990/wiki/index/list_of_presets). These are **different** from the oratory1990 presets made available via the [AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq) project. The AutoEq presets (included in Neutron, SoundSource, etc.) are automatically generated based on oratory1990's headphone **measurements** only. Unlike oratory1990's hand-created presets, the **AutoEq presets are not developed and tested using physical headphones** and do not account for THD, clipping, and other variables.
